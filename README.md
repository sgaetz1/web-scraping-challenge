# web-scraping-challenge

This project features a web application that scrapes various websites for data related to the mission to mars and displays the information in a single HTML page.

The initial scraping is done in a Jupyter Notebook in the file ```mission_to_mars.ipynb```, using BeautifulSoup, Pandas and Requests/Splinter. Items being scraped are the latest news title and paragraph text, the current featured Mars image, a table of facts about Mars, and images and names of the four hemispheres of Mars.
