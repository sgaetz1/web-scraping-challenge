# web-scraping-challenge

This project features a web application that scrapes various websites for data related to the mission to mars and displays the information in a single HTML page.

The initial scraping is done in a Jupyter Notebook in the file ```mission_to_mars.ipynb```, using BeautifulSoup, Pandas and Requests/Splinter.
